![FK-NS-CN](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da7e17e3-e007-404e-8309-429d8f213f23)




Developed a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake. Performed data cleaning, text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF, Lemmatization / Stemming), and applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes. Achieved high accuracy in detecting fake news, helping in misinformation prevention.

## ❓Problem Statement: 
We consume news through several mediums throughout the day in our daily routine, but sometimes it becomes difficult to decide which one is fake and which one is authentic. Our job is to create a model which predicts whether a given news is real or fake.

### 📝 Project Flow:

1. Problem Statement
2. Data Gathering
3. Data Preprocessing:
###### Here we perform some operation on data
 - Tokenization
 - Lower Case
 - Stopwords
 - Lemmatization / Stemming

4. Vectorization (Convert Text data into the Vector):
 - TF-IDF

5. Model Building :
 - Model Object Initialization
 - Train and Test Model

6. Model Evaluation :
 - Accuracy Score
 - Confusition Matrix
 - Classification Report


## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used
